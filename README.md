# Paper Tape Punch Block

An ITA-2 punch/splice block for 11/16 inch paper tape. A cheap way to edit or create punched tape.

# A Note On Materials

Original 11/16 inch tape data holes were 0.072 inches (1.83 mm) in diameter, feed holes were 0.046 inches (1.17 mm). Sourcing materials to the tenth of a millimetre proved more practical. Punching rods of 1.8mm and 1.2mm were substituted. Feed hole dowel pins are 1mm diameter.

I got better results with the narrowest tape gaps. 0.2mm shim washers work best, but 0.3 will allow joined tapes.


# Constructing the Punch Block

Refer to the exploded view diagram to see how everything fits together. It's much easier to seat the dowel pins first. I apply a little permanent threadlocker,
locate them with thin nosed pliers, then tap them in with a hammer on a metal surface being careful not to damage the underside of the board. Once everything is loosely assembled insert a tape and nudge the shim washers in snug to it before tightening to reduce any wiggle in the tape path.



# Using the Punch Block

For a new tape, punch 5 feed holes then move the tape through and hook the first onto the protruding dowel pin to secure the tape in place. Advancing the tape in this way 5 holes at a time will line up the next section of blank tape. There are 5 punching rows because this is the traditional way teletype code is written out in blocks.

I prefer to hold the block in my hand while punching - it's easier to locate the holes. Squarely seat the punch in each hole first then sharply and mechanically plunge it down to cut the paper. If you check all the chad has seperated before advancing the tape it will be easier to re-punch and clear it then. If you have the block sitting on a desk while punching, adjust the depth of the rods in the pin vise so that the tip will not hit the surface and dull the cutting edge.
